# Quiz: Development Tools and Quality Assurance

## Instructions
Answer the following questions to test your understanding of modern C++ development tools and quality assurance practices. This quiz covers static analysis, code formatting, debugging tools, and their integration into development workflows.

## Questions

### 1. Static Analysis Tools
**Which clang-tidy check category is most important for HFT performance optimization?**
- A) `bugprone-*`
- B) `performance-*`
- C) `modernize-*`
- D) `readability-*`

### 2. Code Formatting
**What is the recommended column limit for clang-format in HFT development and why?**
- A) 80 characters - for compatibility with legacy terminals
- B) 100 characters - for better readability on wide screens
- C) 120 characters - to maximize code density
- D) 150 characters - for complex trading logic

### 3. Debugging Tools
**Which GDB command would you use to set a breakpoint that only triggers when a specific trading symbol is processed?**
- A) `break process_market_data`
- B) `break process_market_data if symbol == "AAPL"`
- C) `watch process_market_data`
- D) `catch process_market_data`

### 4. Memory Analysis
**What Valgrind tool would you use to detect race conditions in a multi-threaded trading application?**
- A) `memcheck`
- B) `callgrind`
- C) `helgrind`
- D) `massif`

### 5. CMake Integration
**How would you enable clang-tidy analysis for all source files in a CMake project?**
- A) Add `-DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY=clang-tidy` to cmake command
- B) Set `CMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY` variable in CMakeLists.txt
- C) Use `find_program()` to locate clang-tidy and set the variable
- D) All of the above

### 6. Performance Considerations
**When working with performance-critical trading code, what is the recommended approach to quality assurance?**
- A) Run all static analysis tools on every build
- B) Focus analysis on critical path functions only
- C) Disable all quality checks for release builds
- D) Use only runtime debugging tools

### 7. CI/CD Integration
**In a GitHub Actions workflow for C++ quality checks, what should happen if clang-format finds formatting issues?**
- A) The workflow should pass with warnings
- B) The workflow should fail and block merging
- C) The workflow should auto-format and continue
- D) The workflow should skip formatting checks

### 8. Pre-commit Hooks
**What is the primary benefit of using pre-commit hooks for code quality in HFT development?**
- A) Faster compilation times
- B) Automatic code generation
- C) Catching quality issues before code review
- D) Reducing testing requirements

### 9. Debugging Techniques
**Which debugging approach would be most effective for investigating intermittent crashes in a trading system?**
- A) Setting breakpoints at random locations
- B) Using conditional breakpoints with specific conditions
- C) Running the program multiple times with gdb
- D) Adding print statements throughout the code

### 10. Quality Standards
**For HFT systems, what should be the tolerance level for memory errors in critical trading paths?**
- A) Low tolerance - occasional errors are acceptable
- B) Medium tolerance - errors should be rare
- C) Zero tolerance - no memory errors allowed
- D) High tolerance - focus on performance over correctness

### 11. Tool Selection
**Which tool would you choose for detecting undefined behavior in C++ code?**
- A) clang-format
- B) cppcheck
- C) gdb
- D) valgrind (memcheck)

### 12. Performance Profiling
**What Valgrind tool provides call-graph profiling information useful for optimizing trading algorithms?**
- A) `memcheck`
- B) `callgrind`
- C) `helgrind`
- D) `massif`

### 13. Code Review Integration
**How should static analysis tool output be integrated into the code review process?**
- A) Ignore tool output during review
- B) Include tool output as review comments
- C) Run tools only after code review
- D) Use tools only for final verification

### 14. Build System Integration
**What CMake command would you use to create a custom target for running static analysis?**
- A) `add_custom_target(analyze ...)`
- B) `add_custom_command(analyze ...)`
- C) `target_link_libraries(analyze ...)`
- D) `install(TARGETS analyze ...)`

### 15. HFT-Specific Considerations
**When balancing code quality with performance requirements in HFT development, what should be prioritized?**
- A) Always prioritize code quality over performance
- B) Always prioritize performance over code quality
- C) Balance both based on the specific use case and criticality
- D) Focus only on meeting minimum quality standards
